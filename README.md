Known Bugs:

For some reason, the 5 star image does not load when expanding the recipe. The file path matches exactly with the path in recipe cards, but for some reason, GitHub reads this as a link relative to the page, not the repo. Pretty sure this is a bug on GitHub's end.

I could not get the Service Worker to work. It refuses to cache images from recipe expand, and tries to fetch the image each time when expanding the recipe.
